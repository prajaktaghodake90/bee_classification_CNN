Aim : BEE CLASSIFICATION USING CNN

Abstract:
In this project, a classifier is build to classify types of honey bees in their respective class labels. A CNN is implemented using Keras Sequential API and evaluated on Honey Bee dataset using Accuracy as an evaluation metric. The results demonstrates that it is good classifier. The test accuracy can be improved by using large dataset.
