Aim : BEE CLASSIFICATION USING CNN

Abstract:
In this project, a classifier is build to classify types of honey bees in their respective class labels. A CNN is implemented using Keras Sequential API and evaluated on Honey Bee dataset using Accuracy as an evaluation metric. The results demonstrates that it is good classifier. The test accuracy can be improved by using large dataset.

Implementation and Specifications:

Libraries used:
⦁	skimage
⦁	Numpy
⦁	Matplotlib
⦁	sklearn

Framework used:
⦁	Tensorflow==2.0
⦁	Python 3.7

Dataset: Honey Bee 
⦁	Training Samples : 570
⦁	Testing Samples : 144

Optimizer and Loss functions used:
⦁	ADAM
⦁	Binary Crossentropy
⦁	ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions

Results:
Evaluation Metric : Accuracy
Accuracy : 52 %

Conclusion and Future Scope:
A CNN Claasifier is build using keras Sequential API which classifies honey bees in their respective classes. The results for this task using CNN Classifier shows good performance in terms of accuracy but can be improved and optimized using large training dataset.
Additionally, the training images can be pre-processed using image processing libraries and packages which will further enhance the testing results.
